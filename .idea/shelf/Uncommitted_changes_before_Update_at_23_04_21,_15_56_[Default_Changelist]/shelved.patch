Python\nenables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing\nflexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was\ndesigned to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or\nCython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational\npotential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,\nand chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and\ninterfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical\ncoordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and\n`astropy.coordinates`).\n\n`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by\nstudents in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been\nused in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been\nused in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive\nvisualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,\ndesign, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting\nscientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission\n[@gaia] by students and experts alike.\n\n# Mathematics\n\nSingle dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\\pi/x}$\n\nDouble dollars make self-standing equations:\n\n$$\\Theta(x) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n0\\textrm{ if } x < 0\\cr\n1\\textrm{ else}\n\\end{array}\\right.$$\n\nYou can also use plain \\LaTeX for equations\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:fourier}\n\\hat f(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{i\\omega x} dx\n\\end{equation}\nand refer to \\autoref{eq:fourier} from text.\n\n# Citations\n\nCitations to entries in paper.bib should be in\n[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)\nformat.\n\nIf you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred\ncitation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.\n\nFor a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:\n- `@author:2001`  ->  \"Author et al. (2001)\"\n- `[@author:2001]` -> \"(Author et al., 2001)\"\n- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> \"(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)\"\n\n# Figures\n\nFigures can be included like this:\n![Caption for example figure.\\label{fig:example}](figure.png)\nand referenced from text using \\autoref{fig:example}.\n\nFigure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:\n![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nWe acknowledge contributions from Brigitta Sipocz, Syrtis Major, and Semyeong\nOh, and support from Kathryn Johnston during the genesis of this project.\n\n# References\n

+In Natural Language Processing (NLP) Unsupervised Document Classification is mainly done on large and balanced datasets.
+AuDoLab tackles this problem and provides a novel approach to one-class document classification for heavily imbalanced datasets.
 AuDoLab enables the user to  create  user specific out-of-domain training data and classify a heavily underrepresented target class in a target dataset.
